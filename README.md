# KU Live
A reactive app to make KU course registration just a little more bearable.

## Dev Setup (for Sangyoo)
1. Fork to your own repo
2. Clone your fork to your machine (git clone git@github.com:sangyoo91/...)
3. Run `lein ring server` in project directory
4. Run `lein figwheel` in a separate terminal
5. localhost:3000 will have the app
